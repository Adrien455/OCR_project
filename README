# Dependencies

- SDL2
- SDL2_Image
- c standard libraries

# Compile / Recompile

> in parent folder run 'make'

# Running

> in parent folder run './main ~/my_image'
> example : './main Tests/test1.png'

# Output

> segmented letters are saved in datasets/test_image/ folder

# Clean

> in parent folder run 'make clean'

# Code

> loader.c allows the image to be loaded in an SDL application.
> Extensions handled : .bmp, .png, .jpg

> pre_process.c adjusts the brightness, grayscales, denoises, binarizes.
> This step is very important as it makes the character recognition easier.

> rotate.c detects the angle of the text and rotates it to be horizontal.

> segmentation.c detects the letters and saves them in datasets/ folder.

> event_handler.c handles the events (keyboard, mouse, window).

> main.c runs everything.

# Work in progress

> allow the user to see the steps of the pre-processing in the SDL2 window.

> denoise function handles crumpled paper not very well (run './main Tests/test4.png').

> allow the user to rotate the image manually in the SDL2 window (the rotation is automatic).

> fix the segmentation, it is not perfect yet (small i not detected as an example, check datasets/test3). 
> Separate letters from grid and letters from words.
> This can be done by detecting grid coordinates and check if the letter is inside or not.

> implement character recognition with a neural network.

> implement the solver for crosswords.
